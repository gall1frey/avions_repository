# We're AVIONS
Avions is the official Aero-Design club of PESU EC Campus. Established nearly 9 years agom the club roots its scope in a conjunction of the Mechanical and Electronics Departments.

## What we do
Home to those sharing interests in Aerospace Engineering, the club indulges in severa activities ranging from designing and testing to fabricating and assembling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. What's more, the club now looks forward to incorporating development on quadcopters and twin-copters as well!

## Why we do
The club fosters a certain work ethic by means of participating in numerous competitions which are held at collegiate, national and international forums, which in turn administers opportunities to students to expand and exercise their skill sets in the subject.
